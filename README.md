Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera)

I am working on the data set
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip which contains data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. See full description at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The run_analysis.R script does the following:
<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
</ol>
